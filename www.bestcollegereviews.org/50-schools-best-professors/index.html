50 Colleges With the Best Professors </h2>

<p>Professors can be some of the most influential figures you will ever meet. While many school rankings include &#8220;academic rigor&#8221; as a way to determine the quality of scholarship at a given institution, this can fall short, and ignore a number of important factors. Factors like the ability of students to actually access professors, the extent to which the school enables collaboration between students and faculty, and if students rank professors positively or not. For this reason we&#8217;ve constructed our own rankings of the top 50 schools in the nation with the best professors.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Academic Reputation (25%): as found in US News Rankings, schools are ranked on a scale from 0-100.</li>
<li>Student-Faculty Ratio (25%): the ratio between total undergraduate student population and the total number of undergraduate faculty.</li>
<li>Composite Faculty Rank (25%): the total average RateMyProfessor score for the college or university.</li>
<li>Faculty Rank Range (25%): for the most reported professor ratings, what is the range between the highest and lowest scores (schools that don&#8217;t rank consistently high in this category are penalized).</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. Amherst College, Amherst, MA</h2>
<p><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1.Amherst-College-Best-Professors.jpg" alt="1.Amherst-College-Best-Professors" width="750" height="445" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4376" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1.Amherst-College-Best-Professors.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1.Amherst-College-Best-Professors-300x178.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1.Amherst-College-Best-Professors-600x356.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/><br/>
This member of the Five Colleges Consortium is the oldest college in Massachusetts, and perennially a top ranked liberal arts school. This year Amherst was ranked the second best liberal arts school in the nation by US News and World Report, and the 10th ranked liberal arts school by Forbes. The college is known for an unusually open curriculum, allowing freshman to take advanced courses and seniors to take introductory courses if they should choose. This places greater trust in quality students and instructors to create their own good outcomes and course interactions. A small student body (around 2,000 students) and a low student-teacher ratio (8 to 1) aids in creating quality interactions in class. Amherst has been known for quality instruction for years, so much so that in 2007, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/education/10harvard.html?_r=0">Harvard and Columbia consulted Amherst</a> when reviewing their teaching programs.</p>
<h2>2. Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, PA</h2>
<p><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2.-Swarthmore-College-Best-Professors.jpg" alt="2. Swarthmore-College-Best-Professors" width="750" height="471" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4377" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2.-Swarthmore-College-Best-Professors.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2.-Swarthmore-College-Best-Professors-300x188.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2.-Swarthmore-College-Best-Professors-600x377.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p>Swarthmore is one of the <a href="http://www.gamedayconsultant.com/news-articles/the-ivy-league-the-little-three-the-little-ivies-and-the-hidden-ivies">&#8220;little Ivies,&#8221;</a> and one of only three schools to hold the number one spot of the US News liberal arts rankings. Swarthmore is noted as the number one value for a private school in the US, and also for its rate of <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions/unspun/index.php">over 90% of graduates</a> who attend either graduate or professional school, as well as 20% of graduates that proceed to garner their Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), numbers only topped by CalTech, Harvey Mudd, and Reed College. Swarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium with Bryn Mawr and Haverford, allowing students to cross register at all three, as well as for Swarthmore students to register at UPenn&#8217;s College of arts and sciences (a school sharing a Quaker heritage). The school itself is quite small, with just over 1,500 students, with a student faculty ratio of 8 to 1.</p>
<h2>3. United States Military Academy, West Point, NY</h2>
<p><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3.Westpoint-Best-Professors.jpg" alt="3.Westpoint-Best-Professors" width="750" height="508" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4378" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3.Westpoint-Best-Professors.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3.Westpoint-Best-Professors-300x203.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3.Westpoint-Best-Professors-600x406.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/><br/>
While not for everyone, for the select few who gain admission to West Point (you must both gain admission from the school and be nominated, often by a Senator), you are offered a full ride by the US Army (provided you serve in the armed forces upon graduation). Most graduates leave the academy commissioned as second lieutenants in the Army, though graduates may choose to be commissioned in another branch of the armed forces if wanted. Teaching styles at West Point follow the Thayer system, which focuses on daily homework, brought to class and collaboratively discussed. Curriculum is highly structured at West Point, with all students taking the same classes until junior year, including mathematics, information technology, chemistry, physics, engineering, history, physical geography, philosophy, leadership and general psychology, English composition and literature, foreign language, political science, international relations, economics, and constitutional law. Regardless of major, all graduates receive a Bachelor&#8217;s of Science. Slightly over 4,500 cadets attend the school, which has a student faculty ratio of seven to one. West Point was the <a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/west-point-2893">24th ranked national liberal arts school</a> by US News this year.</p>
<h2>4. Bryn Mawr College, Lower Merion Township, PA</h2>
<p><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4.Bryn-Mawr-College-best-professors.jpg" alt="4.Bryn-Mawr-College-best-professors" width="750" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4379" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4.Bryn-Mawr-College-best-professors.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4.Bryn-Mawr-College-best-professors-300x180.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4.Bryn-Mawr-College-best-professors-600x360.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/><br/>
Bryn Mawr is a small (1,300+ undergraduate students) women&#8217;s liberal arts college that is one of the seven sisters colleges as well as the tri-college consortium (with other quaker-founded schools Haverford and Swarthmore). Bryn Mawr is tied for the 27th ranked liberal arts college in the nation by US News, and the 65th ranked overall college by <a href="http://www.forbes.com/colleges/bryn-mawr-college/">Forbes</a>. The college is noted for small class sizes, with over 3/4th of classes having under 20 students. The most popular majors are STEM heavy for a liberal arts school, with the most popular majors including (in decreasing rank) mathematics (11% of students), English, psychology, political science, and biology/biological sciences. There have been numerous professors of great fame at Bryn Mawr, and the institution itself has been progressive in organizing its academic programs, being the first institute of higher education to award doctorates in social work, as well as to award graduate and doctorate degrees to women.</p>
<h2>5. Harvard University, Cambridge, MA</h2>
<p><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5.Harvard-University-Best-Professors.jpg" alt="5.Harvard-University-Best-Professors" width="750" height="499" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4380" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5.Harvard-University-Best-Professors.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5.Harvard-University-Best-Professors-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5.Harvard-University-Best-Professors-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/><br/>
The oldest University in America is also the first large research institution on our list, with 7,200 undergraduates. Though the University has <a href="http://harvardpolitics.com/harvard/harvard-undergraduates-teaching-harvard-doesnt-want-talk/">been ridiculed</a> for the use of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/01/education/students-of-harvard-cheating-scandal-say-group-work-was-accepted.html">Teaching Fellows</a> in undergraduate education, Harvard also offers access to one of the largest concentrations of award winning and renowned professors in the world. Though a larger comprehensive research university, Harvard&#8217;s student-faculty ratio is still low at seven to one. Harvard is the #7 ranked overall university by Forbes and the #2 ranked national university by US News this year.</p>
<h2>6. Stanford University, Stanford, CA</h2>
<p><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5.Stanford-University-Best-Professors.jpg" alt="5.Stanford-University-Best-Professors" width="750" height="501" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4381" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5.Stanford-University-Best-Professors.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5.Stanford-University-Best-Professors-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5.Stanford-University-Best-Professors-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/><br/>
Stanford is the fourth ranked national university on US News and World Report and the 2nd ranked overall college <a href="http://www.forbes.com/colleges/stanford-university/">according to Forbes</a>. Stanford offers a massive range of research opportunities even for undergraduates, many of which are great opportunities to take advantage of their world class faculty. Over 5,000 externally sponsored research projects, largely from Stanford&#8217;s proximity to Silicon Valley, have a value of over $1.3 billion. Even as a research university, Stanford has one of the best student-faculty ratios of schools in our ranking (five to one). Stanford currently has the <a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/2014/03/28/class-of-2018-admit-rates-lowest-in-university-history/">lowest admission rate</a> of any research university in history, so professors have a lot of (at the very least) extremely driven students to work with. The faculty themselves are amazing as well, with 21 current faculty who are Nobel laureates, and hundreds of faculty members holding top honors in their given field.</p>
<h2>7. Washington and Lee, Lexington, VA</h2>
<p><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7.Washington-and-Lee-University-Best-Professors.jpg" alt="7.Washington-and-Lee-University-Best-Professors" width="750" height="318" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4382" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7.Washington-and-Lee-University-Best-Professors.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7.Washington-and-Lee-University-Best-Professors-300x127.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7.Washington-and-Lee-University-Best-Professors-600x254.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/><br/>
Washington and lee is the 14th ranked liberal arts school by US News, and the 33rd ranked overall university by Forbes. Though it has refused to send data to the Princeton Review for years, the 2007 edition of the <i>Princeton Review</i> ranked Washington and Lee 4th for &#8220;Professors get high marks&#8221; and sixth for &#8220;professor accessibility.&#8221; Home to 1,800 undergraduates housed in two college, Washington and Lee has a student-faculty ratio of eight to one. Washington and Lee has a great community centered around student, faculty, and community traditions. One of the more notable traditions enjoys coverage on national news every four years: <a href="http://www.mockconvention.com/#welcome-page">the Mock Convention</a>. A mock presidential election that has predicted the winning presidential nominee every election save two since 1948 (Ted Kennedy in 1972 and Barack Obama in 2008).</p>
<h2>8. Williams College, Williamstown, MA</h2>
<p><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8.williams-college-Best-Professors.jpg" alt="8.williams-college-Best-Professors" width="750" height="496" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4383" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8.williams-college-Best-Professors.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8.williams-college-Best-Professors-300x198.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8.williams-college-Best-Professors-600x397.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/><br/>
Williams College is both the 1# ranked liberal arts college in the nation according to US News, and the 1# ranked overall college by Forbes. The 2,000 students at Williams have no required courses, but must take must complete three arts and humanities, three social sciences and three science and math classes. Oxbridge tutorials, or small discussion and paper-defense-based classes in the styles of Oxford and Cambridge are a unique feature of Williams. While these tutorials are found at other schools, most schools offering tutorials do not offer nearly as wide of an array. In 2010, Williams offered 62 tutorials in 21 departments (including math and science departments) for nearly every level of class. Tutorials are capped at 10 students who are divided into 5 pairs that meet with professors individually every week. Overall, Williams offers a great deal of student-faculty attention through seven-to-one student-faculty ratio. While the number of sharp and motivated students at Williams is surely a factor, quality faculty interactions is also strongly related to Williams&#8217; 1# rank for colleges graduating students within four years .</p>

The wealthiest University (per student) in America is currently ranked #1 for national universities by US News, and #4 overall by Forbes. It&#8217;s <a href="http://library.princeton.edu/">10-library system</a> and University Art Museum (with over 80,000) works are magnets for great scholars and teachers. Though there are over 5,000 undergraduates, student-faculty ratio is low at six-to-one. Another unique facet of the undergraduate experience is the requirement that all students write a senior thesis, which allows for a great deal of interaction with an expert in a student&#8217;s undergraduate specialty. This aligns with Princeton&#8217;s mission to couple a world class research institution with a top-notch liberal arts setting. This enables research-heavy or emerging fields such as neuroscience the benefit of tons of individual instruction and faculty-interaction opportunities. at an undergraduate level.</p>
