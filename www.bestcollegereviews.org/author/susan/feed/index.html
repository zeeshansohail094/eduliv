At its inception, this university&#8217;s name was &#8220;New College,&#8221; and its purpose was mainly to educate clergy. In 1639, the school&#8217;s name became Harvard University, so named for the Rev. John Harvard. Harvard bequeathed half of his estate and his entire library to the school upon his death. This significant bequest led the school to honor him by taking his name.</p>
<p><span id="more-1431"></span></p>
<p>During the colonial era, Harvard utilized a curriculum that focused on rote learning by repeated drilling. This style of learning conformed to the typical teaching styles of this period. The university kept a small faculty, but the professors had illustrious reputations as some of the most learned men of this era. In 1782, Harvard added medical studies to the school&#8217;s programs. Some buildings still standing on the university grounds originated in the 18th century. Massachusetts Hall was built in 1720, and Wadsworth House was built in 1726. The original buildings from the 17th century did not survive; however, the school marks their locations with brass markers.</p>
<p>Harvard University added additional programs during the 19th century, namely law in 1816 and divinity in 1817. Harvard celebrated its bicentennial birthday during the 19th century. On the school&#8217;s 200th birthday, then-President Josiah Quincy publicly displayed the school&#8217;s new shield with the motto &#8220;Veritas&#8221; for the first time. The school adopted this shield officially in 1843. Quincy was Harvard&#8217;s 15th president, and he kept this office between the years of 1829 and 1845. The school&#8217;s teaching methods evolved during this era also. Harvard began offering more classes and a greater variety, allowing students more freedom to choose their classes. Lectures replaced the recitation teaching style as well.</p>
<p>In 1910, Harvard officially adopted crimson as the school color. This color choice originated in the mid-1800s when two students on the rowing team provided crimson scarves to everyone on the team to enable the crowd to pick them out more easily. The idea of school colors was in its infancy then, and the school did not officially vote on this designation until more than a half-century later.</p>
<p>Harvard presidents during the 20th century sought to center its focus on applied learning. President A. Lawrence Lowell worked tirelessly on a new system of &#8220;concentration and distribution.&#8221; This system was designed to help students choose their fields of study more efficiently to enable them to learn and progress more effectively in their courses of study. Lowell also prioritized scholarships and honor programs. During the 20th century, Harvard University also offered more financial aid opportunities to students, increasing the diversity of the student population.</p>
<p>The 21st century has seen additional changes and adjustments for Harvard University. Harvard is prioritizing study abroad programs, offering a variety of opportunities for students to learn in foreign countries. The school has also instituted a revised program of general education that seeks to connect classroom curricula with real-world situations that students will encounter after graduation. During the 21st century, Harvard University has continued its outreach to excelling students of varying financial means to ensure that the school remains diverse. Currently, Harvard University enrolls 17,000 students in regular enrollment and another 30,000 students in non-degree courses.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Students who play sports in high school may want to continue these activities in college. Although the playing field shifts somewhat with progression to collegiate-level sports, many young people continue to participate in organized sports. By learning about the organizations involved in college sports and the recruiting process, a student can prepare for a successful and enjoyable college sports experience.</p>
<p><span id="more-1425"></span></p>
<p><b>Levels of Play</b></p>
<p><img class=" size-medium wp-image-1426 alignleft" src="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/guide-playing-sports-college-300x200.jpg" alt="guide-playing-sports-college" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/guide-playing-sports-college-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/guide-playing-sports-college-600x400.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/guide-playing-sports-college-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/guide-playing-sports-college.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The National Collegiate Athletic Association regulates college-level athletes in three different divisions. Colleges can participate in NCAA sports as Division I, Division II, or Division III schools. Larger colleges typically participate as Division I schools, and smaller colleges fall into the Division II or III categories. Division I and II colleges can offer students athletic scholarships, but Division III colleges cannot offer athletic scholarships to students. The NCAA has specific eligibility requirements for student athletes: Students must have graduated from high school, they must complete a minimum number of academic courses, they must maintain a minimum grade-point average, and they must meet minimum scores for SAT or ACT testing. Student athletes participating in NCAA sports can expect to spend a significant amount of time practicing. The time can vary depending on the division and the type of sport, but athletes can spend up to 20 hours per week practicing during the in-season.</p>
<p>The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics is another college sports association. The NAIA governs college-level athletic programs throughout North America. Generally, colleges participating in NAIA are smaller than NCAA colleges. The NAIA divides colleges into two different divisions, and it offers 13 different sports. Division I of the NAIA compares to Division II of the NCAA, and Division II of the NAIA compares to Division III of the NCAA. The NAIA offers scholarships for student athletes.</p>
<p>Additional college sports associations include the National Junior College Athletic Association, the National Christian College Athletic Association, the United States Collegiate Athletic Association, and various independent conferences. Each association has specific requirements for eligibility, and schools participate in different associations depending on size and other criteria.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>The Recruiting Process</b></p>
<p>High school athletes typically begin the recruiting process before entering college. Because colleges have different sports programs and are part of different sports associations, explore the programs offered by various colleges to narrow your selection. Once you have a list of colleges that match your academic and athletic criteria, begin the recruiting process and visit schools. A high school coach can be a helpful resource during the recruiting process, and a high school counselor can assist you with NCAA or NAIA eligibility requirements and form submission. When pursuing a sports scholarship, follow recruiting protocol carefully. Coaches and guidance counselors can assist you with this. An athletic résumé can be an effective means of introducing yourself to potential colleges. Include athletic achievements and qualifications, education history, employment history, future goals, and references in an athletic résumé. After submitting an athletic résumé, you may receive requests for video recordings and high school coach evaluation of your play. You may also receive requests to interview with college coaches.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>College Visits</b></p>
<p>The itinerary for a recruiting visit to a college typically involves touring the campus, meeting coaches, and meeting team members. Take notes throughout your visit about the facilities, and write down contact information for coaches and team members. Be aware that some sports associations limit the number of recruiting visits an athlete can make to colleges. For example, the NCAA limits athletes to no more than five official visits to Division I and II schools, but no limitations exist for unofficial visits. A key difference between an official and an unofficial visit involves expenses: Schools typically pay for all expenses involved with an official recruiting visit.</p>

<p><b>Committing to Play</b></p>
<p>When you are pursuing a scholarship, the end of the recruiting process may involve receipt of letters of commitment from colleges. A letter of commitment serves as a binding agreement between the athlete and the college, wherein the athlete agrees to attend the college for a specified period of time and the college agrees to provide financial aid for the student. Before signing a letter of commitment, ask questions about the amount of financial aid you will receive, living arrangements, expected playing time, and school atmosphere. After you sign the letter, you have committed yourself to this school. Your focus should turn to maintaining your eligibility so you can attend the school and participate in the sports program.</p>

Early interest in music education was primarily connected to church music. This religious interest in music would lead to the creation of schools to create more skillful choirs and more harmonious church services. Eventually, as higher education developed in the United States, universities and colleges also began dedicated programs in music education, independent of the country&#8217;s initial impulses toward religious music. Many of the first schools of higher learning, as well as musical schools, began in New England. By the 19th century, however, these impulses toward musical higher education were flourishing throughout the country.</p>

These schools are primarily located in the Northeastern part of the country. There are eight total colleges that are considered to be Ivy League. These schools are Brown, Harvard, Cornell, Princeton, Dartmouth, Yale, and Columbia universities and the University of Pennsylvania. Of all institutions of higher learning, these elite schools are considered to be the most outstanding and the most sought-after in terms of acceptance and graduation.</p>
<p><span id="more-1222"></span></p>
<p><b>How the Ivy League Was Formed</b></p>
<p>The term &#8220;Ivy League&#8221; came about in 1954, when the NCAA athletic conference for Division I was formed. At the time, the elitism of these schools was really due to their prestige in the realm of sports like basketball. Although the term &#8220;Ivy League&#8221; was not created until the 1950s, many of these schools were in existence as far back as 1636, when John Harvard became the first benefactor of Harvard University. This school is located in the Boston, Massachusetts, area. Yale was formed in 1702 by a benefactor by the name of Elihu Yale. Yale is located in the state of Connecticut in the town of New Haven. In 1746, the New Jersey school of Princeton was founded and was originally simply named the College of New Jersey. The fourth-oldest university in America is the University of Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1740 by famous founding father Benjamin Franklin. Brown University, founded in 1746, is located in Providence, Rhode Island. The smallest Ivy League school, Dartmouth, was established in 1769 in Hanover, New Hampshire. It received a large endowment of several billion dollars. In 1754, Columbia University began thanks to King George II of England. It is located in New York City. And finally, Cornell University got its start in 1865 thanks to two benefactors named Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White. This school is located in Ithaca, New York.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Rivalries</b></p>
<p>Although this group of elite schools is considered to be part of one big league of the elite, there have been plenty of internal rivalries over the years. Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania have been longtime basketball rivals. Cornell and Harvard have been hockey rivals for many years, and Harvard and Penn have beenlong time football rivals. Many other Ivy League schools have had serious sports rivalries as well. The Yale and Princeton rivalry is considered the country&#8217;s second-oldest college rivalry behind Lehigh University and Lafayette College. The sports that these colleges play were so popular that some teams began playing games in New York City so spectators could come from far away and watch the games. The popularity of both the athletes who played and the college team rivalries brought in a good deal of attention to the schools as well as revenue from ticket sales. There have also been academic rivalries between schools. Mostly, these rivalries are a matter of opinion in terms of which school has the most honor graduates, which schools offer the most prestigious scholarships, and what famous graduates have come from each school.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Accomplishments and Cultural Impacts</b></p>
<p>Each Ivy League college has its own unique accomplishments that make it important. All carry a certain reputation with them, and each school has programs that excel primarily in the medical and law fields, making them some of the most sought-after schools in the world. Their admissions process is very selective, which helps the schools ensure that they only accept the best and brightest. Many famous people have graduated from Ivy League schools, including recent presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. This prestige leads many to believe that these colleges are only for the wealthy and elite. Often, companies look for Ivy League graduates as potential employees, usually preferred by law firms, medical facilities, and large corporations. It has long been coveted to have earned a degree from an Ivy League school. Today, there are other competitors that some claim to be just as good as their Ivy counterparts. Some of these well-known schools include Duke University, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Vanderbilt, and Georgetown University, to name a few. The Ivy League schools are still excellent in both academia and in sports, and they have left a legacy of higher education with an exceptional track record and reputation to go along with them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1220" src="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/peer-pressure-300x153.jpg" alt="peer-pressure" width="300" height="153" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/peer-pressure-300x153.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/peer-pressure-150x76.jpg 150w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/peer-pressure.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Peer pressure can be tough to deal with, especially when you are a teenager or in your college years. The desire to fit in and feel like you are part of a group is completely normal, and most people feel this way their entire lives. The important thing about peer pressure is that it can sometimes be positive, but other times it can be a bad influence in our lives. Combating the pressure of your peers can be challenging but it&#8217;s essential that you know what your own personal values are and where you stand about certain things.</p>
<p><span id="more-1218"></span><br />
<strong>Fighting Peer Pressure</strong></p>
<p>One of the ways you can fight peer pressure is to be involved in a group of friends who are focused on their schooling, and even join a club or sports team. Stay busy and avoid parties where you think drinking and drugs might be involved. Instead, order a pizza and have some friends over for a movie night. Pressure can be in the form of drug or alcohol use, sexual pressure, the pressure to do something wrong like commit vandalism, or even something like bullying.</p>
<p><strong>The Difference With College</strong></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re in college, it can be harder to avoid peer pressure since you&#8217;re on your own, an adult, and maybe even living away from home. Your parents are no longer there to watch over you, and ultimately you will be responsible for the decisions you make. If you ever feel pressured to do something you don&#8217;t like or do not want to do, simply tell the person pressuring you &#8220;thanks but no thanks&#8221; and move on. If you end up in a situation where you feel uncomfortable, graciously leave the situation and go home. If you&#8217;re involved in a more complicated or even dangerous situation, talk to an adult you trust like your parents, your professor, or even the police if you feel the need. You can always stay anonymous if you go to the police. Always remember that you will deal with the consequences of your own actions, so avoiding peer pressure is a good way to stay out of trouble and keep your life on track.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-820" src="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/health-nutrition-college-208x300.jpg" alt="health-nutrition-college" width="208" height="300" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/health-nutrition-college-208x300.jpg 208w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/health-nutrition-college.jpg 334w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" />College students face many day-to-day challenges &#8211; staying healthy through diet and exercise, maintaining good mental health, and keeping up relationships can be very difficult for students saddled with daily exams, quizzes, and projects. Thankfully, a few simple steps can be taken to make healthy living a breeze. Incorporating a few minutes of exercise into your daily routine through walking or biking is a great way to stay fit, and learning to cook will give you the tools you need to make healthy dietary choices. Keep reading to find out more about staying healthy in college.</p>
<p><b>Nutrition and Eating Right</b></p>
<p><span id="more-819"></span></p>
<p>With a limited budget and 24/7 access to fast food and snacks, college students can face big challenges while trying to eat right. Learning how to cook is one of the best things that college kids can do for their health. Students are less likely to go out to eat during the week if they have planned several nutritious meals in advance, and having the skills needed to put together a meal can be useful for years to come and will help you stay fit in the long run. It&#8217;s also important to keep a variety of healthy snacks on hand. Eating raw veggies, fruits, and nuts between meals will give you the energy you need to tackle those study sessions.</p>
<p><b>Exercise </b></p>
<p>Getting enough exercise is vital for students to have a healthy body and sharp mind. Many students find it difficult to stick to an exercise routine, so it&#8217;s important to realize that exercise does not have to happen all at once. Walking or biking to class is a great way to keep in shape during the semester. A person needs about 30 minutes of cardio three times a week to stay healthy, and that time can be broken up throughout the day. Ten minutes of jumping jacks in the morning, a bike ride to class, and sit-ups at night will meet the cardio requirement for your day. Most schools have state-of-the-art gyms that offer a variety of group exercise classes. Finding a form of exercise that you enjoy is the ticket to staying healthy while in college.</p>
<p><b>Study Breaks </b></p>
<p>Studying regularly has been shown to be much easier on the brain than cramming for tests. When students cram the night before an exam, it puts a huge amount of stress on the brain. Intense studying forces the brain to work much harder than it should, leaving lots of room for error &#8211; like completely forgetting the material during the exam. It&#8217;s much healthier to study for short periods on a regular basis. When longer study sessions are in order, frequent study breaks are key to maintaining good mental health. Get up, walk around the room, and stretch your arms, neck, and back. This will improve your blood flow and help you concentrate.</p>
<p><b>Healthy Social Life </b></p>
<p>College students need to learn how to balance a healthy social life with their academic studies. A great way to met new people is to join academic clubs. Most schools offer a number of organizations for everything from language arts to chemistry. Creating a study group is another fun way to get to know other people in your classes (and it&#8217;s been proven that helping others to study helps cement your own knowledge). Joining sports teams is another great way to get in some exercise and make friends with similar interests.</p>
<p><b>Avoiding Alcohol and Drugs</b></p>
<p>The backbone of any healthy lifestyle is the avoidance of drugs and alcohol. This can be accomplished first and foremost by choosing friends with similar values. Students are much more likely to try drugs and alcohol if their friends do them on a regular basis, and hanging out with friends who choose to abstain from these substances is one way to stay on the right path. If you are going to be around friends who are drinking, volunteer to be the designated driver. You&#8217;re not only dedicating the night to getting your friends home safely, but you&#8217;ll also avoid any possible peer pressure that might happen when hanging out with friends who are drinking in a group setting.</p>
<p><b>Maintaining Meaningful Relationships</b></p>
<p>Just because you start a new life in college doesn&#8217;t mean that you should forget about old high school friends. It&#8217;s important to keep in contact with old friends and family members while on this new college journey. Tech-savvy students can keep in contact with old friends and family through Facebook, text messaging, Skype, and email. Weekly Skype dates are perfect for catching up with old friends and touching base with parents. Making an effort to see old friends during holiday breaks is another great way to show that you still care about them. Making new friends and nurturing older relationships can be tricky, but it&#8217;s worth it to keep meaningful people in your life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-786" src="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/college-students-disabilities-200x300.jpg" alt="college-students-disabilities" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/college-students-disabilities-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/college-students-disabilities.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />When a student graduates from high school, they have a lot of important decisions to make about what they will do for the rest of their lives. One of those decisions concerns the pursuit of further education. Obtaining a college degree is an increasingly important and often essential path to success in today&#8217;s economy. When it comes to going to college, however, students with disabilities have a unique set of challenges that they must face and overcome. In addition, as young adults, they will be the ones who are primarily responsible for addressing issues that are related to their disability. These issues include, for starters, knowing their abilities and limitations. In addition, they will need to become familiar with rights and responsibilities under the law, find the resources that are available to disabled students, and seek help through various organizations and services, both on campus and off campus.</p>
<p><span id="more-784"></span></p>
<p><b>Preparing For College</b></p>
<p>All students need to prepare for college first by understanding the difference between the rules in college and high school. Education is compulsory by law from kindergarten through high school, and at the same time, schools are required to some extent to help students cope with issues such as disabilities. When it comes to college, however, students are not required by law to attend. This means that in many cases, it is up to the student to pursue accommodations for any physical or mental issues that may hinder their ability to learn or otherwise get the best out of their college experience. For instance, according to the Department of Education, disabled college students must make their condition or conditions known to the school in order to receive protection under the law, and they must do so in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The second step in preparing for college is to choose the right school. In addition to knowing which college has the best courses for one&#8217;s intended major, it is also necessary to learn about how much help they offer disabled students. This is because some colleges and universities have a better reputation for accommodating students with disabilities than others. To do this, the student must understand their own abilities and limitations and learn how to advocate effectively for themselves. Students will also have to obtain the necessary documentation that proves and explains their disability. Another important task a student will need to carry out is obtaining financial aid. When taking a tour of the college, prospective students will need to know where the school&#8217;s disability service office is located and the services they provide, as well as how to discuss their concerns with counselors. For example, hearing-impaired students will need to know if they can get help through sign language interpreters, note-taking services, or other forms of aid.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Know Your Student Rights</b></p>
<p>Students with impairments who are looking to attend college should become familiar with their rights under the law. The government has crafted a variety of laws to protect students with disabilities from discrimination in college so that they can receive the best education possible. Two of the most important laws that guarantee equal access to education for students with disabilities is the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, particularly Section 504, mandates that colleges that receive federal funding may not exclude or discriminate against students with disabilities. It also requires colleges to provide disabled students an equal opportunity to receive an education. This includes providing reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. These mandatory accommodations, for instance, include disabled parking spaces for students with qualifying conditions, such as kidney or liver diseases, or if they&#8217;re wheelchair-bound. The Americans with Disabilities Act mandates protections for all students, whether the college receives federal government funding or not. Disabled students who are victims of discrimination can attempt to resolve this with the school, and if this doesn&#8217;t work, they can file a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights, which is a department of the U.S. Department of Education.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Success in College</b></p>
<p>Even though there are laws that require colleges to make certain accommodations for disabled students, students will still need to make their own efforts to achieve academic success. For example, they will need to make use of the various assistance options that are available at the school&#8217;s disabled student services offices. They should also make the effort to network with other students. Students who are new to college can benefit from engaging other students with disabilities, as they can share experiences and dispense helpful advise. Meeting with instructors to discuss any special needs or concerns is also important for college success. This is all in addition to the normal tips that all students must keep in mind in order to maximize their educational experience. These include mastering proper study habits, prioritization of tasks, and time management.</p>

<p><b>Organizations</b></p>
<p>The changes that come with attending college can be a challenge for students with disabilities. To help overcome these challenges and promote a successful college career, there are numerous organizations around the country. These organizations may be for the benefit of a specific discipline or disability or for the disabled community as a whole. In addition, these organizations often stand as advocates or the voice for the community, seek to promote positive change and equality, and offer advice. Organizations are also often a source of valuable resources and may provide assistance as needed.</p>

Whether you attend public or private school or you are homeschooled, there are several important things you will need to know about not only getting into college but how to pay for it as well. Being fully prepared for college can be stressful, especially for those who are homeschooled. Here are a few tips to help guide you through the college selection process, testing, getting your foot in the door, and financial aid.</p>
<p><span id="more-790"></span></p>
<h3><b>Searching for Colleges</b></h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re looking for a college to attend, think about the major you&#8217;ve chosen. Look for schools that are accredited for that major, and read about the college to be sure they will offer the courses you need or want to take. Decide whether you want to enroll in a college that provides online classes, if you want to stay on campus, or if you&#8217;d just prefer a school closer to home that you can drive to and from. You will also want to determine whether you&#8217;d like to enroll at a state university, private college, or some other college. Write down a list of your wants and must haves as well as a list of extra perks. Use this as a starting point of criteria when you send out those applications.</p>
<h3><b>Testing</b></h3>
<p>Most high school students must take some form of tests in order to get into college. The two most popular and widely used tests are the SATs and the ACTs, but there are other tests that colleges use as well. Be sure you know all about the testing prerequisites before you apply so that you will have scores to give them with your application. If you are homeschooled, you will want to find out when you can be scheduled to take these tests. It is also recommended that you look at some sample questions and take a few practice tests. This way, you will know what to expect and be prepared on testing day.</p>
<h3><b>Admissions</b></h3>
<p>Find out exactly what your target college requires for admissions. Most schools also have an application fee that must be sent in with the application. In most cases, an essay is also required. Some modern schools even ask for video essays or presentations. Be sure to get creative and sell yourself to the college. Convince them that you will be an asset to their university, and talk about your personal goals. Include past achievements such as any awards you&#8217;ve won, any community service you&#8217;ve done, and any teams or organizations you have been a part of. Just because you are homeschooled does not mean you don&#8217;t have anything to offer, so focus on the things you have accomplished and highlight them.</p>
<h3><b>Financial Aid</b></h3>
<p>Of course, part of going to college is determining how to pay for it. Fortunately, there are plenty of different financial aid options available. First, fill out any required federal aid forms. Then, you can opt to apply for grants, which are money given to some students that does not have to be repaid. There are also many different scholarships sponsored by different private companies and other organizations that you can apply for. If you choose to apply for scholarships, it is recommended that you apply as early as you can and for as many as you can. In addition to scholarships and grants, there are many low-interest student loans available as well. Do your research and find out which loans have the best rates as well as which ones you will qualify for.</p>
<h3><b>Additional Advice</b></h3>
<p>Keep in mind that college is a time to expand your horizons and work toward that degree you&#8217;ve been hoping for. If you want to save money, choosing a close-by campus or community college or taking online classes might be your best option. If you decide to stay in a dorm, make a comprehensive list of everything you will need before you head to school. Ask your parents, friends, and family members for good advice about college life. Remember to always keep your eyes on the prize and focus on studying as much as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-794" src="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/studying-tips-300x183.jpg" alt="studying-tips" width="300" height="183" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/studying-tips-300x183.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/studying-tips.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />No matter the area of life, success depends on both working hard and working smartly. This is particularly true of a student&#8217;s college career, for without the right attention to college studies, the student cannot achieve good grades and may even end up not earning a degree at all.</p>
<p><span id="more-793"></span></p>
<p>As is true in other fields, success in academia requires the development of particular skills that improve one&#8217;s effectiveness and efficiency. Working hard at college studies is pointless if the correct ideas are not studied and if the student does not make the most of the available study time. That is why it is important for every college student to develop a sound set of study skills. The proper study skills enable students to focus on the correct material when they are studying, and they ensure that students use their time efficiently so that they get the most out of their studies and do not end up allowing their studies to crowd out other important activities and disciplines. Developing good study skills is how college students can study smartly, and there is no shortage of resources available for helping one develop the appropriate study techniques.</p>
<p>Although there are certain study skills that apply to only one subject and not others, the skills for studying well are generally the same whether the student is studying math, history, science, literature, or any other topic. The most important thing that students can do to improve their study skills is to make sure that they have a proper study environment and manage their time effectively. When students study in a location that allows them to focus entirely on their studies, they retain much more of what they are studying. Furthermore, having a well-planned schedule enables one to stay organized and on track in studying for tests and completing written assignments. Many students run into the most problems academically when they fall behind and have to play catch-up for an entire semester. Following a reasonable schedule can prevent this from happening; all it takes is a little planning and a strong commitment to abide by the study schedule that is created.</p>
<p>College students today benefit not only from the many online study resources that assist them in developing excellent study skills but also from the fact that most institutions of higher learning today have a study center where they can receive tutoring, help in establishing good study habits, and other academic assistance. When students fall behind or are having trouble with their studies, these on-campus resources can help them succeed in their studies once more. All that it takes is for the student to be willing to ask for help when necessary, for the individuals that staff these study centers are well-equipped to deal with students in every major.</p>
<p>Whether a student has been studying for a long time or is just starting college, it is almost certain that the learner will benefit from resources that offer guidance on students developing sound study skills. The following resources represent some of the best that the Internet has to offer in making sure that students know how to study effectively and efficiently.</p>
