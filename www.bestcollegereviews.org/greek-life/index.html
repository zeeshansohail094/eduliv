The 50 Best Colleges For Greek Life </h2>
<p><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life.jpg" alt="best-greek-life" width="750" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2460" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life-300x120.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life-600x240.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life-150x60.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p>Fraternities, sororities – Greek life. Thanks to movies like Animal House and Old School the very words conjure up pictures of wild parties and crazy college students, but these movies have created a picture that is not entirely accurate. Fraternities and sororities are “value-based organizations dedicated to the development of character and lifelong friendships.” Greeks don’t only behave like the movies portray but also have a positive influence on campus, are known for their philanthropic efforts, academic achievement, and community building. Becoming involved in fraternity or sorority can be one of the best choices an undergraduate makes, as the Greek community becomes a family away from home. </p>
<p>We have compiled a list of the best colleges and universities for Greek life &#8211; schools where participation is high, criminal offenses are low, and current Greeks are satisfied with their experience. This ranking was made based on the following criteria:</p>
<p> • Percentage of students enrolled in Greek life.<br/>
• Number of Greek organizations on campus.<br/>
• Greek organizations must be chapters of National organizations, such as, but not limited to, the Panhellenic Conference, Interfraternity Council, or Multi-Cultural Greek Council.<br/>
• Number of criminal offenses occurring on campus during 2011-2013.<br/>
• Average Greek Rank rating.</p>
<h2>50. Denison University</h2>

Lafayette College participates in the Order of Omega, a leadership honor society for fraternity and sorority members. Order of Omega recognizes juniors and seniors who have exemplified high standards in scholarship and leadership in their respective communities. There are over 500 chapters recognized in North America, and Lafayette College is home to the Rho Tau Chapter, which was chartered on March 15, 1999.

<h2>47. Bucknell University</h2>
<p><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life-bucknell.jpg" alt="best-greek-life-bucknell" width="600" height="383" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2248" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life-bucknell.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life-bucknell-300x192.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life-bucknell-150x96.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"/></p>

Overall, with 41 percent of students involved, Bucknell Greek life is active and vibrant.</p>
<h2>46. The University of North Carolina – Wilmington</h2>
<p><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life-univ-north-carolina.jpg" alt="best-greek-life-univ-north-carolina" width="600" height="388" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2249" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life-univ-north-carolina.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life-univ-north-carolina-300x194.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-greek-life-univ-north-carolina-150x97.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"/></p>

These traditions are just a small part of the overall comradery and strong community life that the ten Greek organizations at Allegheny College provide. Each chapter typically provides over 7,000 hours of community service each year, and academically, members of fraternities and sororities perform at or above the all-College GPA average. </p>

<p>With two of the greatest presidents in our history for a namesake, Washington &#038; Jefferson College doesn’t disappoint. Founded in 1781 and located in Washington, Pennsylvania, Washington &#038; Jefferson has an excellent reputation for academics, and serves approximately 1,500 students. Perhaps less known is Washington &#038; Jefferson’s thriving Greek life. Washington &#038; Jefferson is home to ten Greek organizations. A look at some numbers from their website tells the story best: Fifty-seven hold executive board positions in student organizations, Greeks are involved in over 20 different campus sports teams and hold executive board positions in over 50 clubs on campus. Washington &#038; Jefferson’s Greek organizations collectively raised $20,412 in cash donations for various projects and community groups during the 2014-15 academic year. They also clocked 1,248 philanthropy hours spent fundraising for charitable causes, and 3,844 service hours spent in hands-on service to local causes and community organizations.</p>
