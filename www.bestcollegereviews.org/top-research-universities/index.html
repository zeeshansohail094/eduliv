<p>Some of the world’s most famous discoveries have been made through university research. From the invention of the telegraph, the discovery of AIDS, the origination of the internet, and current advances in stem cell research, our nation’s universities are the hub of knowledge and discovery, 56% of our nation’s basic research is being conducted at universities. Students are an integral part of university research; studies show that students who engage in research are twice as likely to graduate, five-times more likely to go on to graduate school, and have more successful careers after graduation. These students go on to become the next generation of scientists, engineers, teachers, and leaders in government and industry.</p>
<p>Our list was chosen based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The university has at least one research center or institute that functions under the jurisdiction of the university, but as a separate entity. (35%)</li>
<li>There are opportunities for undergraduates to participate directly in research. (35%) </li>
<li>The university receives federal research funds. (30%)</li>
</ul>
