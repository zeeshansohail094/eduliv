The 50 Most Beautiful College Arboretums </h2>

<p>For many alumni, one of the most lasting impressions of their college experience, embedded deep in their memories with strong images is the trees, bushes, flowers, beautiful buildings, green spaces, the clock tower, and the general landscape of the campus. Many schools have become centers of beauty and enlarged their very educational mission to the community at large, as well as their students, by developing and designing arboretums and botanical gardens. These sanctuaries are conducive to study, contemplation, meditation, and research. Ancient wisdom and modern research confirm a love of nature and spending time in nature as important to emotional, spiritual, social, and physical health. In fact, the founders of modern science sought to uncover the order of nature for man’s good, while also standing in awe of the beauty and immensity of it and unleashed a host of discoveries that have changed the world. </p>
<p>In the midst of our stressed out society, where no one seems to have time for anything, the words of Mother Teresa aptly apply to many of our amazing universities’ arboretums and gardens.  “See how nature &#8211; trees, flowers, grass- grows in silence; see the stars, the moon, and the sun, how they move in silence&#8230; We need silence to be able to touch souls.”<br/>
 <br/>
The following criteria were used to compile our ranking of the most beautiful college arboretums:<br/>
• Size of Arboretum<br/>
• Size of the collection<br/>
• How long the garden has been established<br/>
• Opportunities for college students<br/>
• Connection with the community</p>
<h3>50. Hilltop Arboretum at Louisiana State University</h3>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/LSU-Hilltop-arboretum.jpg" alt="LSU Hilltop arboretum" width="750" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2841" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/LSU-Hilltop-arboretum.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/LSU-Hilltop-arboretum-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/LSU-Hilltop-arboretum-600x400.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/LSU-Hilltop-arboretum-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p>The origin of the arboretum at LSU traces back to a farmer and his wife in 1929. The Smiths planned a garden to follow the form of a cathedral: &#8220;It had a central great hall or nave, and from that &#8211; in every direction &#8211; ran hallways leading to other rooms and on to others, with niches and passageways of every description. The nave and other rooms were the grassy plots; the walls were trees, shrubs, and bamboo; the pillars were old tree trunks.&#8221; Since that humble beginning and soaring vision, the “Hilltop”, as it is known at LSU, now contains 150 species of southern native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers displayed on 14 acres. Currently it functions to educate the community and students through the beauty of nature, cared for by the Robert Reich School of Landscape Architecture and the Friends of Hilltop. </p>
<h3>49. Garden of the Coastal Plain &#8211; Georgia Southern University</h3>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Garden-of-the-Coastal-Plain-Georgia-Southern-University.jpg" alt="Garden of the Coastal Plain - Georgia Southern University" width="750" height="492" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2842" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Garden-of-the-Coastal-Plain-Georgia-Southern-University.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Garden-of-the-Coastal-Plain-Georgia-Southern-University-300x197.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Garden-of-the-Coastal-Plain-Georgia-Southern-University-600x394.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Garden-of-the-Coastal-Plain-Georgia-Southern-University-150x98.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p>Amit Ray wrote that “Looking at beauty in the world, is the first step of purifying the mind.”  At the Garden of the Coastal Plain, part of Georgia Southern University, this proves true indeed for the public at large as well as students. Walk, look, relax, read, contemplate, draw, and simply enjoy the 11 acres of gorgeous garden. Home to 20 of the state’s protected species and many other trees, shrubs and plants, “The Garden is a research and educational resource for faculty and students and provides undergraduate and graduate programs, projects, and internships as well as continuing education programs of interest to the community.” Not only can visitors enjoy the collection of native azaleas, arboretum, children’s museum, butterflies and hummingbirds in season, and nature in general, there is also living history displays with the Weathervane Barn and Rural Life Exhibit and the Oak Grove One Room Schoolhouse among others. </p>
<h3>48. W. J. Beal Botanical Garden – Michigan State University</h3>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/W.-J.-Beal-Botanical-Garden-%e2%80%93-Michigan-State-University.jpg" alt="W. J.

<p>The W. J. Beal Botanical Garden is a five-acre botanical garden that serves as an outdoor teaching and research laboratory at Michigan State University. It is the oldest continually maintained university botanical garden in the United State, dating back to 1872 when Professor William James Beal fostered the idea of a garden to be used for educational purposes as part of the Department of Botany. The garden began as a nursery, and was followed by test plots of 140 species of forage grasses and clovers that were planted in part of the garden known as “Sleepy Hollow.” The arboretum on campus was established in 1874, two years after the founding of the garden, and began as two rows of swamp white oaks. Today, the garden displays 1,800 plant taxa, organized in economic, systematic, landscape, and ecological groupings.</p>
<h3>47. Marsh Botanical Garden &#8211; Yale University</h3>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marsh-botanical-yale-university.jpg" alt="marsh-botanical-yale-university" width="750" height="422" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2845" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marsh-botanical-yale-university.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marsh-botanical-yale-university-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marsh-botanical-yale-university-600x338.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marsh-botanical-yale-university-150x84.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p>The Marsh Botanical Garden is named after famed paleontologist and dinosaur discoverer Othniel Charles Marsh and was established in 1900. Designed by landscape architect Beatrix Farrand during the 1920’s and 1930’s, it grew slowly. It wasn’t until two professors in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology were appointed as directors, that the gardens, greenhouses, and grounds were restored, developed, and brought back into focus for the university. Currently, there are 2000 species of orchids on eight acres that features botanical gardens, multiple greenhouses, and an arboretum that is a public green space and educational. Marsh Botanical Garden “offers space, supplies and growing expertise to research laboratories from any department at Yale, but [is] principally involved with Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB), Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) and School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.” Promoting both research and public greenspace, the gardens have carnivorous plants, desert plants, tropical plants, and an extensive outdoor collection. </p>
<h3>46. University of Delaware Botanic Gardens</h3>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/univ-delaware-botanical-garden.jpg" alt="univ-delaware-botanical-garden" width="750" height="324" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2846" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/univ-delaware-botanical-garden.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/univ-delaware-botanical-garden-300x130.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/univ-delaware-botanical-garden-600x259.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/univ-delaware-botanical-garden-150x65.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p>Beginning in the 1950’s, the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources (CANR) started what has become a vibrant 15 acres with 12 different gardens. Since the Fifties, the gardens have grown and evolved in a name (originally called Clark Gardens), size, scope and mission into the University of Delaware Botanic Gardens, which is now home to over 3000 species of plants. The website mentions that there is a “strong emphasis on Holly, Maple, Magnolia, Oak, and Viburnum.” UDBG functions as a research center, laboratory, and a classroom in which students study in plant biology, botany, plant pathology, landscape design, ornamental horticulture, and entomology by hands-on learning. UDBG offers summer and school-year internships that provide excellent opportunities for students. The public also greatly benefits from the work at UDBG through lectures, tours, and other events. </p>
<h3>45. University of South Florida Botanical Gardens</h3>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/University-of-South-Florida-Botanical-Gardens.jpg" alt="University of South Florida Botanical Gardens" width="750" height="278" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2847" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/University-of-South-Florida-Botanical-Gardens.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/University-of-South-Florida-Botanical-Gardens-300x111.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/University-of-South-Florida-Botanical-Gardens-600x222.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/University-of-South-Florida-Botanical-Gardens-150x56.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p>The University of South Florida Botanical Gardens were established in 1969 and primarily served as a teaching and research facility for the biology department. At that time, the Gardens were a little more than a wilderness, with no pine trees, only native oaks. Throughout the years, the Gardens have continued to grow and develop into the picturesque landscape it is today. Attracting more than 35,000 visitors annually, the Gardens consists of 16 acres of more than 3,000 plants. The Gardens provide opportunities for ongoing research in medical botany, service-learning for USF students, as well as a great way for student groups to be involved on campus. In addition to being an important part of campus life, the Gardens also attract plant enthusiasts from outside the student population through plant festivals and other events.</p>
<h3>44. Peavy Arboretum &#8211; Oregon State University</h3>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Peavy-Arboretum-Oregon-State-University.jpg" alt="Peavy Arboretum - Oregon State University" width="750" height="497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2848" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Peavy-Arboretum-Oregon-State-University.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Peavy-Arboretum-Oregon-State-University-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Peavy-Arboretum-Oregon-State-University-600x398.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Peavy-Arboretum-Oregon-State-University-150x99.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p>In 1924, the Forest Club at Oregon State University noted the following: &#8220;an Arboretum for the School of Forestry &#8211; an outdoor laboratory in which experiments with various tree species and silvicultural practices could be conducted and a ‘botanical garden’ of trees &#8211; has been long dreamed of and planned for by the faculty and students of the school.” Progress was made during that year, and the Peavy Arboretum was dedicated in 1926, and has since served as a gateway to explore the McDonald Forest and has provided an outdoor teaching lab for generations of students. The history found in the arboretum is rich, with Native American sites, the home of the original Oregon State Forest Nursery, as well as the site of a Civilian Conservation Corp camp from the 1930’s.

<p>In the fall of 1970, students and faculty at what was then Orange State College began to notice an orange grove on campus that was in a serious state of the disease known as Quick Decline. Neglected for years, this disease meant almost certain death for the trees; most of this area was a field of wild mustard, and there was little hope held for saving any of the trees. Banding together in a united effort to salvage some of the citrus trees, the idea of Fullerton Arboretum was born. Unfortunately, the group was more successful in gaining student and community support than it was in saving the trees, but in December of 1977, a groundbreaking ceremony was held, and the Fullerton Arboretum became reality. Today, the Fullerton Arboretum is the largest botanical garden in Orange County, covering 26 lush acres of over 4,000 unique and unusual plant species from around the world. </p>

<p>In 1915, William F. Curtis purchased the present day site of Cedar Crest College when it was little more than a bare expanse of corn stubble surrounding a single walnut tree. Dr. Curtis was cultivating both students and trees. In fact, he often compared the growth of the college’s trees to the growth of the students, saying they both needed careful cultivation and nurturing. Today, the Arboretum is filled with trees representing most of the continents, a testimony to the world’s biodiversity. The Arboretum provides students with hands-on opportunities to learn about botany, tree identification, and ecology while studying in a beautiful landscape.</p>

<p>The Earl L. Core Arboretum began in 1948 when the University acquired its site. At that time Professor Earl Lemley Core, chairperson of the Biology Department, convinced President Irvin Stewart to set the property aside for the study of biology and botany. It is now a 91-acre arboretum of mostly old-growth trees on a steep hillside along the Monongahela River flood plain. There are over three miles of trails that provide access to the densely wooded areas, as well as three acres of lawn planted with specimen trees. The arboretum is currently managed by the university’s biology department. Interestingly, the arboretum hosts an event to taste pawpaws, the largest fruit native to West Virginia. Pawpaws have a very luscious, tropical flavor that some describe as a combination of banana, mango, pineapple, and strawberry with a smooth, creamy texture. Students and others have the opportunity to taste this unique fruit grown at Core Arboretum.</p>

<p>Although the Davidson College Arboretum has only been a national arboretum since 1982, it has been dreamed of and developed for more than 100 years. In 1855, “a few ladies of Davidson College” proposed landscape remodeling to the Board of Trustees, planting the vision of a campus arboretum. Students organized tree plantings, and in 1869, the faculty approached the Board of Trustees once again to &#8220;make the campus and its contents represent in time the forest growth of the state, and, if possible, the general botany of the region.&#8221; Over the next 100 years, the campus was planted with all sorts of exotic and indigenous plants. Even future president Woodrow Wilson is rumored to have planted a tree during his time as a student. Finally, in 1982, the dream of being a national arboretum was realized, and Davidson College is now recognized as being one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.</p>

<p>The History of the Morris Arboretum goes back to 1887 and a barren hill called Chestnut Hill. The Morris family, wealthy from the iron industry, began landscaping and cultivating the land that is now home to the gorgeous 92-acre arboretum with over 12,000 labeled plants. The Arboretum conducts four major activities: education, research, outreach, and horticultural display. Morris Arboretum provides research and outreach services to state agencies, community institutions and to citizens. There are ample opportunities for community involvement classes, tours, lectures, and fun activities such as a climb 50 feet up in the treetops called the Out on a Limb canopy walk. For students, there are classes and research opportunities, internships, academic enrichment, not to mention free admission to the garden with student identification for study breaks and relaxation. </p>

<p>Haverford College Arboretum is the oldest planned college landscape in the country, marking its 180th anniversary in 2014. Haverford College, founded by Welsh Quakers in 1833, was landscaped by English gardener William Carvill, who sought to transform the college grounds. Trees line the roadways, framing and complementing the open spaces while other trees are planted in circles of five and seven, dotting the rolling landscape. Several of the original oak trees are still standing today. On February 21, 1902, an ice storm nearly wiped out all the Maple Allée along College Lane. This unfortunate event promoted a group of supporters to form the Campus Club. The happy result has been a group dedicated to the improvement and preservation of the College Landscape while maintaining features of Carvill’s gorgeous landscape for students and the community to enjoy.</p>

<p> “The goal is to provide the university and public with an environment conducive to learning, teaching and demonstrating the importance of trees, woody plants and landscapes of intrinsic beauty.” This mission was born from co-founder of Illinois University, Jesse Fell with the first trees planted in 1868. Now managed by the School of Biological Sciences, the Arboretum helps educate students in biology, botany, horticulture, and agriculture. In combination with other centers at IU, such as the Plant Library Greenhouse and Environmental Outdoor Learning Center, the educational mission is strong. There are now 490 acres with over 4000 trees, representing over 100 varieties at Fell Arboretum. Notably, the commitment to education extends beyond students to the whole community. For example, the curator of the arboretum, Patrick Murphy, promotes knowledge and appreciation of trees and plants through a weekly radio program. With lectures, workshops, volunteering, and many other events Fell Arboretum ranks high on our list.</p>

<p>The Connecticut College Arboretum has a rich history and tradition stretching back to its establishment in 1931. Since its beginning the college has been dedicated to the mission of teaching, research, conservation, recreation and public education. The Arboretum now spans 770 acres and is utilized in at least 30 different college courses, part of the school’s mission to create a “living laboratory”. There are three major plant collections: 120 acres of trees and shrubs from around the world, 30 acres of native plants, and three acres of diverse wooded plants in a garden setting. An example of the outstanding connection to learning fostered by the Arboretum is, “the symbiosis of the Environmental Studies Program, the Goodwin-Niering Center for the Environment and the Arboretum” which “provides an outstanding model of an ethically and environmentally sound community.”</p>
<h3>4. Carleton College Cowling Arboretum</h3>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/carleton-college-arboretum.jpg" alt="carleton-college-arboretum" width="750" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2810" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/carleton-college-arboretum.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/carleton-college-arboretum-300x160.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/carleton-college-arboretum-600x320.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/carleton-college-arboretum-150x80.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p>The Carleton College Cowling Arboretum, also known as “the Arb,” is used extensively as an outdoor classroom by a number of Carleton courses, especially in Biology and Geology. Students are able to carry out observations and experiments in a natural setting within walking distance of the campus, an invaluable asset for classes with a field component. The Arboretum is divided into the Upper Arboretum south of Highway 19 and the Lower Arboretum, which is north of the highway; &#8220;lower&#8221; because it contains the low-lying floodplain of the Cannon River. The Upper Arboretum has some trails designated for bike use and generally smaller areas of natural communities. In contrast, the Lower Arboretum has populations of rare plants and animals; therefore the Lower Arboretum has fewer trails, no bike use, and large areas of natural habitat. The Arb consisted of approximately 880 acres of land adjacent to the college and was created under the leadership of President Donald J. Cowling and Professor Harvey E. Stork in the 1920s.</p>
<h3>3. Saint John&#8217;s Abbey Arboretum &#8211; Saint John’s University</h3>

<p>Founded in 1856 by Benedictine monks, and located in the transition zone between the prairies to the southwest and hardwoods to the Northeast, Saint John&#8217;s Arboretum is home to a variety of plants and animals. Saint John&#8217;s Abbey has been, “guided by the Benedictine principles of stability, hospitality, and stewardship. In 1997, this longstanding principle of stewardship led the monks to designate the abbey lands a natural arboretum.” The Arboretum is more than 2,500 acres of lakes, prairie, oak savannah, and forest; the conifers found at Saint John’s were planted in 1896 by the monks, and are part of the oldest pine plantation in the state of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Offering something unique during every season of the year, the Coker Arboretum is at the center of one of the most beautiful university campuses in the nation- the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Managed by the North Carolina Botanical Garden, it is one of the Garden&#8217;s oldest features. The Arboretum dates back to 1903 when Dr. William Chambers Coker, the university’s first Professor of Botany, began to develop a five-acre boggy pasture into an outdoor classroom. He desired to create a place dedicated to the study of trees, shrubs, and vines native to North Carolina. Over the course of 20 years, he developed the arboretum, adding many East Asian trees and shrubs to the collection. Today, the garden is a flourishing testimony to Dr. Coker’s legacy and vision, displaying a wide variety of plantings including flowering trees and shrubs, along with bulb and perennial displays. </p>
<h3>1. F.R. Newman Arboretum – Cornell University</h3>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cornell.jpg" alt="Cornell" width="750" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2822" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cornell.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cornell-300x160.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cornell-600x320.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cornell-150x80.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p>The F.R. Newman Arboretum is filled with panoramic views overlooking the rolling hills and valleys that were carved out by Fall Creek following the retreat of glaciers over 10,000 years ago. Not only is the F. R. Newman Arboretum a beautiful place to enjoy picturesque views, it is a place for the scientific study and public exhibition of a diversity of trees and shrubs. The collection includes nut trees, crabapples, oaks, maples, shrubs, and urban trees that comprise a 100-acre pastoral setting. Specialty gardens in the arboretum include the Zucker Shrub Collection and the Treman Woodland Walk. The Arboretum is part of the larger Cornell Plantations, which boast a mature botanical garden, and a diverse network of nature preserves in addition to the F. R. Newman Arboretum. These exquisite gardens make Cornell one the most beautiful campuses in the nation.</p>
