The 50 Best College Newman Centers </h2>

<p>Colleges are like miniature worlds, teeming with their own life, diversity, and atmospheres. In this country, schools are a slice of our melting pot society with diversity and pluralism in everything from race to religion. In light of this, colleges and universities, as well as other stakeholders in the future of our country, spearhead various centers and initiatives. In terms of religion, according to Pew Research, Christianity makes up 70 percent of the total population, with about 21 percent of the total who identify as Catholics. Various Christian groups and centers are active on campuses, so we at Best College Reviews decided to look specifically at Catholic Newman Centers. These centers are named after the famous 19th-century English intellectual and convert, John Henry Newman, whose work The Idea of a University is still studied in schools around the world today. Newman Centers function as a place for young Catholics to further religious ideals and goals through prayer, study, religious services, community service, and relationship building activities. The information used for the ranking is taken from school’s Newman Center websites and The Newman Connection an online institute dedicated to helping educate and encourage young Catholics in their faith. Statistics on student populations were gathered from The Newman Connection.</p>
<p>The Newman Centers on this list were chosen based on the following criteria:</p>
<p> • The Newman Center offers regular Mass times during the week.<br/>
• The Newman Center regularly offers Eucharistic Adoration, Confession, and other opportunities for spiritual growth.<br/>
• The Newman Center offers regular community-building events.<br/>
• The college must have a Catholic population of greater than 100 students.<br/>
• Percentage of Catholic students, relationship with the local parish, and specific site amenities was also taken into account.</p>

<h2>48. Columbia University in New York – Columbia Catholic Ministry</h2>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/48-Columbia-in-NY.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3290" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/48-Columbia-in-NY.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/48-Columbia-in-NY-300x160.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/48-Columbia-in-NY-600x320.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/48-Columbia-in-NY-150x80.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/><br/>
Columbia Catholic Ministry hosts a variety of events each week, including Sunday Mass and Supper, weekly Holy Hour and cookie baking social, and Confession. Because Columbia is located in the heart of New York City, there are numerous of off-campus opportunities for students. The group travels to Harlem to work with Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity on Friday mornings, serving soup in the soup kitchen, and they travel to the Upper East Side each month for Catholic Underground, a special Holy Hour led by Fr. Benedict Groeschel’s Franciscan Friars of the Renewal. Participating in these unique service opportunities play an integral part of the Catholic student life at Columbia University in New York.</p>
<h2>47. Murray State University – Murray State Newman House</h2>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/47-Murray-State.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3289" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/47-Murray-State.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/47-Murray-State-300x160.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/47-Murray-State-600x320.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/47-Murray-State-150x80.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/><br/>
This quote found on the Murray State Newman House homepage captures the essence of their mission: “The world does not need what you have, but who you are.” The Murray State Newman House functions mainly to help students grow academically, emotionally, and socially. There is a very small percentage of Catholics on campus (10 percent) and even less in the larger community (2 percent). With this in mind, and working with the local St. Leo’s Catholic Church, students serve the campus and community, engage in Bible studies, host fun events, attend lectures or spend quality time with fellow Catholics. St. Leo’s has Mass everyday, but Tuesday and there are opportunities for engaging in ministries such as retreats at the local Camp Bear Creek. There is a specific Mass for students on Sunday nights followed by a free-dinner where all are welcome. Recently, there has been great excitement at the potential at MSU’s Newman House, with FOCUS missionaries coming in light of a grant of $100,000 from Catholic Extension. </p>

It all started in 1928 when 36 students got together for the Catholic Students’ Club. This small group of young men and women began regular meetings and has now blossomed into the St. Paul Catholic Newman Center, serving many young NDSU Bison Catholics with over 80 small group Bible study, service, and prayer groups as part of FOCUS ministry. The Center has a chapel, study lounges, kitchen, conference rooms, and a social hall. Daily Mass is offered as well as the Sacraments and every semester there is a Koinonia Retreat for spiritual reflection and renewal. Catholics at NDSU also serve and help with Catholic Charities North Dakota, engage in liturgical ministry, work in the Knights of Columbus, or attend various events, workshops, and Catholic speakers. Overall, the St. Paul Newman Center has a strong faith-building mission and sense that many young Catholics have found vital to helping them reach their life goals. </p>

The University of Southern California Caruso Catholic Center is one of the leading university-based Catholic ministries in the United States and is run in conjunction with Our Savior Parish. Approximately one-third of the student population at USC identify as Catholic. The center is a central gathering place for the community of “Catholic Trojans,” both past and present; it is a place for families, alumni, undergraduate and graduate students, young professionals, faculty, staff, and the community to connect, celebrate Mass, get involved in service or participate in in the large number of programs, events, and ministries. Every Thursday night, there is a free community dinner, there are small communities and Bible studies that meet on a weekly basis, retreats, social justice projects, movie nights, shopping trips, bonfires, and more. Without a doubt, the Caruso Catholic Center is one of the best.</p>
<h2>4. University of North Dakota – St. Thomas Aquinas Newman Center</h2>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-Un-of-North-Dakota-2.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3246" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-Un-of-North-Dakota-2.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-Un-of-North-Dakota-2-300x160.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-Un-of-North-Dakota-2-600x320.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-Un-of-North-Dakota-2-150x80.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/><br/>
One of the greatest hopes of the St. Thomas Aquinas Newman Center at the University of North Dakota was to provide residence halls for its Catholic students. This vision became a reality when the Newman House officially opened its doors for the fall semester of 2008. Housing is provided for both men and women; women may live in Kappa Gamma Zeta, Catholic Women of Life. There are currently two men’s houses, one is next door to the women’s house, and the other is next door to the Newman Center; there are plans for a third men’s house to be starting soon. The goal of providing student housing is to foster an environment to grow in virtue and community. There is no doubt that the St. Thomas Aquinas Newman Center supports the Catholic students at the University of North Dakota.</p>
<h2>3. Montclair State University – Newman Catholic Center</h2>

For more than 50 years, the Newman Catholic Campus Ministry has been an established institution at Montclair State University, complimented by a favorable partnership between the Archdiocese of Newark and the University. In fact, in recent years, the Newman Catholic Campus Ministry has been recognized as one of the largest, most active organizations on campus by the Student Government Association. In 2011, they were named “Organization of the Year,” and led the MSU Relay for Life by raising the most funds of any single organization for three years in a row. The Newman Catholic Center serves the Catholic population at Montclair State, of which approximately 50 percent of students identify as Catholic. The Center is located in a 150-year old house adjacent to the University’s Campus &#8211; which houses the Daily Mass Chapel, library, recreation room, and offices for the Chaplain, FOCUS missionaries, and staff operations. Without a doubt, the Newman Catholic Center at Montclair State University is one of the best of the list.</p>
<h2>2. Bowling Green State University – St. Thomas More University Parish</h2>

Founded in 1939, the St. Thomas More University Parish began with the help of some very dedicated students. As early as 1916, there was evidence of a Catholic organization present at Bowling Green State University, but it wasn’t until 1939 that Father Horrigan approved the formation of a Newman Club for university students. Today, the Newman Club serves the Catholic student population of over 7,000 Catholic students and is a flourishing campus club with excellent facilities including a 17-room center complete with a large meeting hall, library, bookstore, and offices. Mass is held daily in the center’s chapel. The Newman Center also offers housing where students can live in community with other committed Catholics.</p>

St. John’s Newman Center at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is like a mini-campus within a campus. The facility includes St. John’s Newman Hall, which offers housing, dining, recreation, and more to students. The Newman Hall has all the amenities of a traditional dorm – fitness center, laundry, study lounges, direct TV, AC, and even a library.

St. John’s Newman Center is vibrant with social activities, Bible studies, faith formation, retreats, academic lectures, and more. There are multiple priests and sisters present to students with daily Mass and with traditional liturgy as well as a more contemporary every weekend.
