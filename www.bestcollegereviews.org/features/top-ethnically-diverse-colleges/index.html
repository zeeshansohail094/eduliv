<p>Presidential Medal of Freedom award winner, author, and poet Maya Angelou said, “It is time for parents to teach young people early on that in diversity there is beauty, and there is strength.” It is true, there is strength in diversity. Students educated in racially and ethnically diverse settings perform better academically and reap greater professional success than peers from more homogeneous learning environments. The advantage of a multicultural education extends far beyond the classroom and professional life. The idea of democracy is truly dependent on the next generation of leaders, leaders who are prepared to engage with individuals and groups that make up the Melting Pot we call America. Only those who can rejoice in the beauty of our differences while valuing human life will change the world.</p>
<p>Our list was based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>No race can have more than 45% representation</li>
<li>At least three races are represented by over 12%</li>
<li>Percentage of total minorities graduated 2012-13</li>
<li>Scholarships, clubs, organizations, and associations available for ethnic groups</li>
</ul>
<p>*Statistics and definitions of race/ethnicity were gathered from the National Center for Education Statistics and Diverse Issues in Higher Education.</p>
