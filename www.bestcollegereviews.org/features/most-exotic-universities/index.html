The University of Tokyo occupies five campuses and is widely considered to be the most esteemed university in Japan. It was the first of Japan’s National Seven Universities. Currently, the University is comprised of 10 faculties, 15 graduate schools, 11 research institutes, 13 university-wide centers, three libraries, and two institutes for advanced study. One of the university’s best known landmarks, Akamon, or the Red Gate, is a relic from the Edo Period and is located on the main Hongo campus. The gate was constructed in 1827 by Nariyasu Maeda, 12th Lord of the Kaga. Akamon is the only gate of its kind still in existence and was registered as a National Treasure before World War II. Tokyo is both the capital and largest city of Japan, and the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. The greater Tokyo area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. </p>

<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1.Hebrew-University-.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3491" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1.Hebrew-University-.jpg 750w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1.Hebrew-University--300x160.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1.Hebrew-University--600x320.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1.Hebrew-University--150x80.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/><br/>
The Hebrew University of Jerusalem was established in 1918, 30 years before the State of Israel. With over 23,000 students, 1,000 staff, seven faculties, 14 schools, eight Nobel Prizes, and over 100,000 alumni, the University is impressive by the numbers. In addition to these notable statistics, the first Board of Governors included Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Martin Buber, and Chaim Weizmann. Not only did the world-renowned Albert Einstein serve on the first Board of Governors, he left the University his personal papers and copyright to them; the Albert Einstein Archives contain over 55,000 items including his personal notes, love letters, and correspondence with his wife, Elsa. The Jewish National and University Library has one of the most impressive book and manuscript collections in the world, housing all material published in Israel including Hebrew manuscripts. Sitting high atop Mount Scopus overlooking the ancient city of Jerusalem, there is no doubt that this is one of the most exotic universities in the world.</p>
