At its inception, this university&#8217;s name was &#8220;New College,&#8221; and its purpose was mainly to educate clergy. In 1639, the school&#8217;s name became Harvard University, so named for the Rev. John Harvard. Harvard bequeathed half of his estate and his entire library to the school upon his death. This significant bequest led the school to honor him by taking his name.</p>
<p><span id="more-1431"></span></p>
<p>During the colonial era, Harvard utilized a curriculum that focused on rote learning by repeated drilling. This style of learning conformed to the typical teaching styles of this period. The university kept a small faculty, but the professors had illustrious reputations as some of the most learned men of this era. In 1782, Harvard added medical studies to the school&#8217;s programs. Some buildings still standing on the university grounds originated in the 18th century. Massachusetts Hall was built in 1720, and Wadsworth House was built in 1726. The original buildings from the 17th century did not survive; however, the school marks their locations with brass markers.</p>
<p>Harvard University added additional programs during the 19th century, namely law in 1816 and divinity in 1817. Harvard celebrated its bicentennial birthday during the 19th century. On the school&#8217;s 200th birthday, then-President Josiah Quincy publicly displayed the school&#8217;s new shield with the motto &#8220;Veritas&#8221; for the first time. The school adopted this shield officially in 1843. Quincy was Harvard&#8217;s 15th president, and he kept this office between the years of 1829 and 1845. The school&#8217;s teaching methods evolved during this era also. Harvard began offering more classes and a greater variety, allowing students more freedom to choose their classes. Lectures replaced the recitation teaching style as well.</p>
<p>In 1910, Harvard officially adopted crimson as the school color. This color choice originated in the mid-1800s when two students on the rowing team provided crimson scarves to everyone on the team to enable the crowd to pick them out more easily. The idea of school colors was in its infancy then, and the school did not officially vote on this designation until more than a half-century later.</p>
<p>Harvard presidents during the 20th century sought to center its focus on applied learning. President A. Lawrence Lowell worked tirelessly on a new system of &#8220;concentration and distribution.&#8221; This system was designed to help students choose their fields of study more efficiently to enable them to learn and progress more effectively in their courses of study. Lowell also prioritized scholarships and honor programs. During the 20th century, Harvard University also offered more financial aid opportunities to students, increasing the diversity of the student population.</p>
<p>The 21st century has seen additional changes and adjustments for Harvard University. Harvard is prioritizing study abroad programs, offering a variety of opportunities for students to learn in foreign countries. The school has also instituted a revised program of general education that seeks to connect classroom curricula with real-world situations that students will encounter after graduation. During the 21st century, Harvard University has continued its outreach to excelling students of varying financial means to ensure that the school remains diverse. Currently, Harvard University enrolls 17,000 students in regular enrollment and another 30,000 students in non-degree courses.</p>

Early interest in music education was primarily connected to church music. This religious interest in music would lead to the creation of schools to create more skillful choirs and more harmonious church services. Eventually, as higher education developed in the United States, universities and colleges also began dedicated programs in music education, independent of the country&#8217;s initial impulses toward religious music. Many of the first schools of higher learning, as well as musical schools, began in New England. By the 19th century, however, these impulses toward musical higher education were flourishing throughout the country.</p>

These schools are primarily located in the Northeastern part of the country. There are eight total colleges that are considered to be Ivy League. These schools are Brown, Harvard, Cornell, Princeton, Dartmouth, Yale, and Columbia universities and the University of Pennsylvania. Of all institutions of higher learning, these elite schools are considered to be the most outstanding and the most sought-after in terms of acceptance and graduation.</p>
<p><span id="more-1222"></span></p>
<p><b>How the Ivy League Was Formed</b></p>
<p>The term &#8220;Ivy League&#8221; came about in 1954, when the NCAA athletic conference for Division I was formed. At the time, the elitism of these schools was really due to their prestige in the realm of sports like basketball. Although the term &#8220;Ivy League&#8221; was not created until the 1950s, many of these schools were in existence as far back as 1636, when John Harvard became the first benefactor of Harvard University. This school is located in the Boston, Massachusetts, area. Yale was formed in 1702 by a benefactor by the name of Elihu Yale. Yale is located in the state of Connecticut in the town of New Haven. In 1746, the New Jersey school of Princeton was founded and was originally simply named the College of New Jersey. The fourth-oldest university in America is the University of Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1740 by famous founding father Benjamin Franklin. Brown University, founded in 1746, is located in Providence, Rhode Island. The smallest Ivy League school, Dartmouth, was established in 1769 in Hanover, New Hampshire. It received a large endowment of several billion dollars. In 1754, Columbia University began thanks to King George II of England. It is located in New York City. And finally, Cornell University got its start in 1865 thanks to two benefactors named Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White. This school is located in Ithaca, New York.</p>

<p><b>Rivalries</b></p>
<p>Although this group of elite schools is considered to be part of one big league of the elite, there have been plenty of internal rivalries over the years. Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania have been longtime basketball rivals. Cornell and Harvard have been hockey rivals for many years, and Harvard and Penn have beenlong time football rivals. Many other Ivy League schools have had serious sports rivalries as well. The Yale and Princeton rivalry is considered the country&#8217;s second-oldest college rivalry behind Lehigh University and Lafayette College. The sports that these colleges play were so popular that some teams began playing games in New York City so spectators could come from far away and watch the games. The popularity of both the athletes who played and the college team rivalries brought in a good deal of attention to the schools as well as revenue from ticket sales. There have also been academic rivalries between schools. Mostly, these rivalries are a matter of opinion in terms of which school has the most honor graduates, which schools offer the most prestigious scholarships, and what famous graduates have come from each school.</p>

<p><b>Accomplishments and Cultural Impacts</b></p>
<p>Each Ivy League college has its own unique accomplishments that make it important. All carry a certain reputation with them, and each school has programs that excel primarily in the medical and law fields, making them some of the most sought-after schools in the world. Their admissions process is very selective, which helps the schools ensure that they only accept the best and brightest. Many famous people have graduated from Ivy League schools, including recent presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. This prestige leads many to believe that these colleges are only for the wealthy and elite. Often, companies look for Ivy League graduates as potential employees, usually preferred by law firms, medical facilities, and large corporations. It has long been coveted to have earned a degree from an Ivy League school. Today, there are other competitors that some claim to be just as good as their Ivy counterparts. Some of these well-known schools include Duke University, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Vanderbilt, and Georgetown University, to name a few. The Ivy League schools are still excellent in both academia and in sports, and they have left a legacy of higher education with an exceptional track record and reputation to go along with them.</p>
