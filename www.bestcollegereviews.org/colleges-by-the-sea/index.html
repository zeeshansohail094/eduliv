The 50 Best Colleges By The Sea </h2>

<p>The seaside. There is something magical about the sea &#8211; poets have written about it since the beginning of time, people want to live by it, swim in it, and love it. The sea is alive, and it touches the soul with its vast mystery – beautiful, terrible, and mesmerizing. In Gustave Flaubert’s famous novel Madame Bovary, his main character speaks of the sea: “Doesn&#8217;t it seem to you,&#8221; asked Madame Bovary, &#8220;that the mind moves more freely in the presence of that boundless expanse, that the sight of it elevates the soul and gives rise to thoughts of the infinite and the ideal?” </p>
<p>When one is considering where to pursue higher education, the environment is a huge factor. College is much more than classes and degrees, it is where some of the most important years of life are spent, and the location is vital. Living by the sea can provide recreation, beauty, and educational opportunity. We have compiled a list of the best sea-side locations for higher education. </p>
<p><strong>Methodology:</strong><br/>
The following criteria was used in determining our ranking:<br/>
• Proximity to the beach (50%).<br/>
• Specific marine educational centers, degrees, or research facilities (30%).<br/>
• Recreational opportunities on the sea (20%).</p>
